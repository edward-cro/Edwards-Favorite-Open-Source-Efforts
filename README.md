# Favorite-Open-Source-Efforts
Let's take over the world -- together!

We've been chewing our cud and paying for it, too, haven't we?
It's almost as if we actually finished writing everything the public needs to do work efficiently in most fields about 10 years ago, but corperations change the U.I. of their product each year and sell it again.
There are better open-sourced guitar tuner android apps than there are purchasable ones on the play store. and a new one will replace the old one every few years. but there were free ones from the start that had better functionality?! what the fuck!

Operating Systems (O.S.O.S!):
- ArchLinux https://www.archlinux.org
    Although not technically an open sourced project, most of it's code is. Coded around K.I.S.S. philosophy, this operating system is one step towards teaching the public how to compute.
    
Programs/Applications:
- Blender https://www.blender.org (3d Object Design, Skeleton Rigging, Animation, Game-engine, the list goes on)
- Inkscape https://inkscape.org/en/ (Vector-based Imaging)
- Gimp https://www.gimp.org (Pixel-based Imaging)
- Pencil2D https://www.pencil2d.org (2d Hand-drawn Animation)

The above four programs boggle my mind as to how we, as a human race, have not shut adobe and it's bullshit business practices down. Blender, clearly the most professional and well-written program on the list, even has a python console built in, with which you have program vector points into place to construct an object using math. what the fuck people oh my god we all just want to be slaves or something.
    
Android App Marketplaces and my favorite apps on them:
- F-droid https://f-droid.org/en/ Fuck yes. So... everything has been done well and for free, is what you're telling me. Google is brainwashing the masses, is what you are telling me.
    - Apps on F-Droid:
      - Tuner (yeah. you read my rant from before) https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.billthefarmer.tuner/
      - Terminux https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/ Pretty sweet! terminal on your android! converse with your phone. the way you use it makes it feel lonely :/
