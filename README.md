# Favorite-Open-Source-Efforts
Let's take over the world -- together!

We've been chewing our cud and paying for it, too, haven't we?

It's almost as if we actually finished writing everything the public needs to do work efficiently in most fields about 10 years ago, but corperations change the U.I. of their product each year and sell it again.

There are better open-sourced guitar tuner android apps than there are purchasable ones on the play store. and a new one will replace the old one every few years. but there were free ones from the start that had better functionality?! what the fuck!

Operating Systems (O.S.O.S!):
- ArchLinux https://www.archlinux.org
    Although not technically an open sourced project, most of it's code is. Coded around K.I.S.S. philosophy, this operating system is one step towards teaching the public how to compute.
    
Android App Marketplaces and my favorite apps on them:
- F-droid https://f-droid.org/en/
    Fuck yes. So... everything has been done well and for free, is what you're telling me. Google is brainwashing the masses, is what you are telling me.
    - Apps on F-Droid:
      - Tuner (yeah. you read my rant from before) https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.billthefarmer.tuner/
